## Description
```
This will be a brief profile website to show employers that I have made from scratched

```



## Custom CSS Classes
.ptitle {
    text-align: center;
    .random {
    float: right;
    
```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1: random:  to create a button that has an img on it of a pair of dice.  (located in the lower right hand corner.)  clicking the img will give an alert pop up message.
