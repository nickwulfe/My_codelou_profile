# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
This will be a brief profile website to show employers that I have made from scratch.  While it is very basic and very barebones, it is a work in progress and I will continue to add to it as I learn mpore about programming.  I' proud of what I did and I understand it's a work in progress.

## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1: random:  to create a button that has an img on it of a pair of dice.  (located in the lower right hand corner.)  clicking the img will give an alert pop up message.  Eventually, I plan on animating the dice and some conditional messages based on high and low rolls.
