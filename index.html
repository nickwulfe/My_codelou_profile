            <p class="ptitle">Work Experience</p>
            <p>I have been in the IT world for almost 10 years, working for ISPs like Charter and Insight, as well as Help Desk jobs for Humana and FGA(First Group of America via Compucom), as well as Hardware based support for Geek Squad City.</p>
            <p>I find that I work well in a problem solving enviroment, tinkering and picking away at issues until I can find a solution, not just a work around.</p>
            <p>I am currently looking to get started in the development world. My current desire is to move into Software Quality Assurance and then see where the business takes</p>

            <p class="ptitle">Berke Personal Assesment</p>
            <p> During my time at Alpine Acess (Now Sykes), they had a professional staffing company called 'Berke'(Link here: ) </p>
            <p> The entire staff took a very long and detailed testing and shortly after the results were in, I was promoted to a coaching position on a new project.</p>

            <p> I included a link to download the assessment below, for your reading pleasure. So now you have a little more insight into the type of worker I am and what to expect, should I work for you.</p>
