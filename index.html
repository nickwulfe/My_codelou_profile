            <p> During my time at Alpine Acess (Now Sykes), they had a professional staffing company called 'Berke'(Link here: ) </p>
            <p> The entire staff took a very long and detailed testing and shortly after the results were in, I was promoted to a coaching position on a new project.</p>

            <p> I included a link to download the assessment below, for your reading pleasure. So now you have a little more insight into the type of worker I am and what to expect, should I work for you.</p>
